    "## Depth First Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm allows to visit the graph in depth allows you to create a forest of trees.\n",
    "It works both on oriented and not oriented graphs with a small modification to allow us to identify the relationships between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structures are:\n",
    "1. `pre` array, to record when a node is discovered\n",
    "2. `post` array, to record when the elaboration of a node is terminated\n",
    "2. `st` array, to record who is the father of the nodes in the visit\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is used for:\n",
    "1. Finding is a path between two nodes exists\n",
    "2. Find id the graph is cyclic or acyclic\n",
    "    - A graph is acyclic if with the dfs we cannot find any *B* arcs\n",
    "3. Find out if removing an vertex will disconnect the graph\n",
    "    - The root of the dfs tree is an articulation point only if it has at leat two children\n",
    "    - Every other vertex V is an articulation point only if it has a child S such that there is no arc B from S or one of the vertices in its subtree to an ancestor of V\n",
    "4. Find out if removing an edge will disconnet the graph (find bridges)\n",
    "    - A Back arc cannot be a bridge\n",
    "    - A Tree arc is a bridge only if there are not Back arcs that connect one of its descendants to one of his ancestors\n",
    "    - Two algorithms; the simplest is disconnecting an edge at a time and calling the dfs. The other one is more efficient, you can use a `low` variable to record the ancestors of the various nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The completion times in the `post` array give you the inverse topological order of the graph, if it is directed\n",
    "    \n",
    "The complexity of the algorithm is:\n",
    "1. `O(|V + E|)` using the adjacency list\n",
    "2. `O(|V^2|)` using the adjacency matrix"
